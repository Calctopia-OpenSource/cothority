User

# User

One of the additions to Personhood has been the creation of a `Dynamic
 Credential`, also called `User`.
Because this credential lives on the blockchain and is completely self
-managed, including password recovery, it got the name `Dynamic`.
The following document describes the user structure, called `DynaCred`:

- [DynaCred 101](./DynaCred-101.pdf)

This is only a partial implementation.
The only library implementing the dynacred structure completely for a client
 is written in Typescript:

- [DynaCred TypeScript Library](https://github.com/c4dt/omniledger/tree/main/dynacred)
