# CSADMIN - The Calypso CLI

The `csadmin` command line interface offers a straightforward way to interact
with the Calypso ecosystem. Combined with its brother - `bcadmin` - , it
provides the fastest and simplest way to use Calypso.

## Complete scenario

This scenario shows a complete use path from the creation of the LTS to the
recover of encrypted data.

In this scenario we assume the following:

- A roster has been created and has a ByzcoinID \<byzcoin id>
- There is a writer user, which has the key \<writer id>
- There is a reader user, which has the key \<reader id>
- There is a document darc \<doc darc>, which is has the following rules:
    `spawn:calypsoWrite - <writer id>`
    `spawn:calypsoRead - <reader id>`
- The default admin darc has the rule:
`spawn:longTermSecret - <admin id>`

Refer to `cothority/byzcoin/bcadmin` to learn how to set up this environment.
For most of the commands presented it is also possible to not provide any
`--sign` or `--darc`, which will use by default the admin darc and the admin
identity.

For testing purposes, we recommend running `go build && ./run_nodes.sh -d tmp -v
2` from `cothority/conode` in order to launch a test setup with 3 conodes. Then
a roster can be created with `bcadmin create tmp/public.toml`. The \<byzcoin id>
needed later will be printed.

**1) Authorize nodes**

Each node (sometimes called *conode*) must agree to process LTS (Long Term
Secret) / DKG (Distributed Key Generation) transactions for a particular
ByzcoinID. This must be done locally for each node, providing the ByzcoinID and
the private key file of the node. A ByzcoinID that has not been authorized by (a
majority of) the nodes won't be able to perform requests for the Calypso
service.

The following command must be executed from the localhost of each node:

```bash
$ csadmin authorize <private.toml> <byzcoin id>
```

**2) Create an instance of LTS**

Spawn a new instance of the LTS contract and show the information about the
contract as read from byzcoin:

```bash
$ csadmin contract lts spawn # uses the default admin darc and key
> Spawned new LTS contract. Its instance id is:
> <lts instance id>
$ csadmin dkg info --bc bc-*.cfg --instid <lts instance id>
```

**3) Start a new DKG**

With the instance id of the previously spawned LTS contract, start the new DKG.
X is the collective public key:

```bash
$ csadmin dkg start --instid <lts instance id>
> LTS created:
> - ByzcoinID: <byz id>
> - InstanceID: <inst id>
> - X: <lts public key>
```

It is also possible to directly export the pub key to a file with "-export",
which send the hex string representation to STDOUT.

**4) Spawn a write instance**

With the instance id of the previously spawned LTS contract and the public key,
spawn the write instance:

```bash
$ csadmin contract write spawn --instid <lts instance id>\
        --secret "aef123" --key <lts public key>\
        --darc <doc darc> --sign <writer id>
> spawned a new write instance. Its instance id is:
> <write instance id>
```

Note: Data stored with `--secret` will be encrypted using a `kyber.Point` and it
must be provided as a hexadecimal string. Depending on the suite used, this has
a limitation on the size. For the default suite used (ed25519), this limitation
is 29 bytes, which means no more than 58 hexadecimal chars. Therefore, it is
possible to store additional data in two fields: 'data' and 'extra data'. The
'data' field should contain data encrypted with a symetric key stored in the
secret, while the 'extra data' field should contain any public information.
'data' can be set with the `--data` option or directly from STDIN using the
`--readData` option. 'extra data' can be set with the `--extraData` option or
directly from STDIN using the `--readExtra` option. Note that `--readData` and
`--readExtra` can NOT be used both at the same time.

**5) Spawn a read instance**

With the instance id of the previously spawned write instance, request a read on
the encrypted secret:

```bash
$ csadmin contract read spawn --instid <write instance id> --sign <reader id>
> Spawned a new read instance. Its instance id is:
> <read instance id>
```

Note: Calypso never return a secret without first re-encrypting it. This is why
a public key must be specified for a read request. By default, it uses the
public key of the signer to specify what public key should be used to re-encrypt
the data. But it is possible to provide a different public key as a hexadecimal
string:

```bash
$ csadmin contract read spawn --instid <write instance id>\
          --key <hex pub key> --sign <reader id>
```

Note: `--darc` is not needed because it will use the DARC associated with the
write instance.

**6) Send a re-encrpyt request**

With the read and write instances, it is now possible to request the encrypted
 secret, which comes re-encrypted with the public key given in the read
 instance. The response, `DecryptKeyReply`, is exported and saved to a file:

```bash
$ csadmin reencryt --writeid <write instance id> --readid <read instance id> -x > reply.bin
```

Note that the data has been re-ecrypted under the public key specified in the
read instance. This is why the final step - decrypt - is needed.

**7) Decrypt a re-encrypted secret**

With the re-encrypted secret saved previously in the `reply.bin`, the secret can
now be decrypted. By default, it uses the private key of the signer to decrypt
the re-encrypted secret:

```bash
$ csadmin decrypt < reply.bin
> Key decrypted:
> aef123
```

Alternatively, the path to a private key file can be provided:

```
$ csadmin decrypt --key <private key path> < reply.bin
```
